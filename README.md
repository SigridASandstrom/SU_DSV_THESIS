# SU_DSV_THESIS
This is the code for my Master's of Computer and Systems Science thesis project.

The purpose of the thesis is to use machine learning to predict if a woman will develop breast cancer based on risk factors. The used machine learning models are SVM, GNB, DT, RF, and XGBoost. The used dataset is the PLCO Breast Dataset provided by the National Cancer Institute.
